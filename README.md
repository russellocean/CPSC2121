# CPSC 2121: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Russell Welch, Clemson University

- Sophomore, BS in Computer Science
- Spring Semester, 2023

---

### Course Objective

This repository contains the lab assignments and solutions for the CPSC 2121 course at Clemson University. The objective of this course is to study data structures and algorithms fundamental to computer science, abstract data-type concepts, measures of program running time and time complexity, and algorithm analysis and design techniques. The lab portion of the course aims to reinforce the material learned during the lecture.

### Course Requisites

The prerequisite for this course is CPSC 1020 or CPSC 1070. The corequisite for this course is the corresponding lecture, CPSC 2120.

### Assignments and Class Format

Each week, the assignment is posted on Canvas, with submission through Gradescope on Monday. Students may start work in advance; however, they are still required to attend the lab. A brief lecture is given at the beginning of each lab during Monday’s lab meeting. After the lecture, students may leave after they finish the lab assignment. Lab assignments are due by the end of the following Monday (11:59 PM) unless otherwise specified.
